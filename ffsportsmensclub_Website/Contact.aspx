            <h3>Hare Study</h3>
            <p>Purpose: To monitor hare populations and use this as an indicator for predator populations (lynx) as well.</p>

            <p>We have applied for funds to continue this project for the 4th year. It initially involved setting up 
            4 hare pellet count survey plots east of town. Each plot consists of 4 stakes, each 10m apart. Around 
            each stake we count all pellets within a 1m radius (annually) and then ensure the site is clean in preparation 
            for the following year. This is alot more fun than it sounds. If you aren't involved in scatology you should be!</p>

            <p>Data is turned in to the MNR, who include it in their provincial data summary.</p>
