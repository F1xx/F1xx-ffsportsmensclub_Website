                <p>The rifle range is open to club members. It has berms at 50 yards, 100 yards and 200 yards. It's a great place to teach the novice shooter in a safe environment. 
                    Also a great place to try-out your sights before big game season.</p>

                <p>The Range Officer is Willy Anderson and can be contacted at 274-6702.</p>

                <p>A handgun club meets at the handgun range on the club's site. Contact Willy Anderson at 274-6702 for more information.</p>
