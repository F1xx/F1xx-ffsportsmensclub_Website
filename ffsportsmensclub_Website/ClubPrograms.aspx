                <h3>Skeet</h3>

                <p>Skeet has a long-standing history at the Fort Frances Sportsmen's Club range at Frog Creek, 
                    and still has a dedicated group of shooters who hit the range on Tuesday nights to aim at targets 
                    flying at 60 miles per hour. Skeet shooting requires quick reflexes and a steady aim. The shooters 
                    stand in various stations on a semicircle that faces two trap houses, with targets flying out of the 
                    houses, one or two at a time from opposing directions, with a total of 25 in each series. </p>

                <p>It's a really fun sport you don't need much of a blast to break them, but the key is movement; it's all about the swing. 
                    The sport takes some getting used to, and like anything, the more you practice at it, the better you'll get. 
                    You have to shoot where the target is going to be, not where it is, and that's a hard thing to do.</p>

                <p>The average cost is $7 per person per round to pay for the targets and the shells to load your gun-no more than the cost of 
                    going to see a movie. New shooters are always welcome, and can get individualized instruction on Thursdays at the range.

                <h3>Rifle</h3>

                <p>The rifle range is open to club members. It has berms at 50 yards, 100 yards and 200 yards. 
                    It's a great place to teach the novice shooter in a safe environment. Also a great place to try-out 
                    your sites before big game season.</p>

                <h3>Handguns</h3>

                <p>HANDGUN  RANGE  USERS Prior  to  September  2,  2015,  the  Ontario  Chief  Firearms  Office  (CFO)  
                    required  members to  take  a  Club  Level  Handgun  Safety  Course  in  order  to  obtain  a  long  
                    term Authorization  To  Transport  (ATT)  in  order  to  bring  their  handgun  from  their  listed 
                    residence  to  the  range  and  back.  The  member  participation  in  the  Safety  Course  was verified  
                    by  two  (2)  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  who  signed  as  references  when the  members  ATT  
                    was  applied  for. Since  the  passing  of  Bill  C-42  on  September  2,  2015,  the  conditions  for  obtaining  
                    a  long term  ATT  have  changed.  Either  5  conditions  or  6  conditions  were  automatically electronically  added  
                    to  the  RPAL  of  holders  who  met  certain  criteria.  The  6th  condition  is the  ability  to  transport  a  
                    Restricted  Firearm  to  or  from  an  approved  shooting  range  by the  most  direct  route.  If  the  RPAL  holder  
                    did  not  possess  a  long  term  ATT  as  of September  2,  2015,  then  this  condition  was  not  added  and  has  to  
                    be  requested  from the  CFO’s  office  by  the  member.   The  Fort  Frances  Sportsmen’s  Club  requires  all  members  
                    who  want  to  use  the  Handgun Range  to  have  taken  a  Club  Level  Safety  Orientation.  New  members  or  members  
                    who have not previously taken this Safety Orientation will be required to do so.  Contact  Willie  Anderson  274-6702. </p>

            <h3>Hare Study</h3>

            <img src="Images/hare.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Hare being shown" />
        </div>
            <p>Purpose: To monitor hare populations and use this as an indicator for predator populations (lynx) as well.</p>

            <p>We have applied for funds to continue this project for the 4th year. It initially involved setting up 
            4 hare pellet count survey plots east of town. Each plot consists of 4 stakes, each 10m apart. Around 
            each stake we count all pellets within a 1m radius (annually) and then ensure the site is clean in preparation 
            for the following year. This is alot more fun than it sounds. If you aren't involved in scatology you should be!</p>

            <p>Data is turned in to the MNR, who include it in their provincial data summary.</p>

            <h3>Cougar Watch</h3>

            <img src="Images/ClubPrograms/cougar.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Cougar being shown" />
        </div>
            <p>Purpose: To gather evidence of the presence of a wild cougar population in Ontario.</p>

            <p>We are entering our 3rd year with this province-wide program. We wait for a reliable sighting 
                and then set up a station in that area. Each station consists of trail camera(s), hare snare apparatus, 
                scent and visual attractants. New for 2009 is a commercially manufactured scent post/hare snare from Envirotel (P.Q.). 
                They have developed their own scent lure and once set up, this need only be refreshed once a month.</p>

            <p>The monthly monitoring would include collection of any hair samples and scats at the site, refreshing the scent lure, exchanging 
                camera cards and replacing camera batteries. Samples are sent to the MNR lab in Peterborough for analysis, and all pistures that 
                could be those of a cougar are forwarded as well.</p>

            <p>In 2008 one photo, identified as "it could only be a cougar" by experts in Canada and the U.S., was taken by a program camera. 
                The program relies on a great deal of chance, but as it grows we may get more positive results.</p>

            <p>The seeding project was organized by Jeff Johnston and Ben Wiersema.</p>

            <p>Abitibi Bowater was contacted, maps were obtained, seed ordered and records kept of the number of kilometres traveled and the number of kilometres seeded.</p>

            <p>Johnston mounted a spreader on the back of his ATV, and using his half ton, hauled the bags of seed to the various sites indicated by the company. 
                It took several days to complete the job as the roads to be sown were scattered throughout the Crossroute Forest.</p>

            <p>Len Noonan, Henry Miller and Richard Boileau assisted Johnston on different days. Eighty-two kilometres were seeded.</p>

            <h3>Moose Management Review</h3>
                <div class="col-md-3">
                    <img src="Images/ClubPrograms/moose.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Moose being shown" />
                </div>
            <p>Last summer the MNR announced a review of the provinces moose management program. Meetings were held to review these programs. 
                One of the meetings, held in Dryden, brought together hungers from around the area.</p>

            <p>Sportsmen’s Club members Jeff Johnston, Brad Houghton, Darold Shute, Henry Miller, Ben Wiersema, and Blair Beadow attended. 
                As well, Bruce Hamilton, representing Zone A, and Jack Hedman, representing OFAH, travelled from Fort Frances.</p>

            <p>Gord Easton, from the MNR office in Wawa, presented a package for information and discussion. The package mentioned how caribou, elk, and 
                deer will be managed in relation to each other. It outlined what tools should be used to manage the moose population and what changes could 
                be made to the resident tag draw.</p>

            <p>A review of the tag draw is necessary because of concerns raised by hunters about the process and because of changes in moose populations.</p>

            <p>The presenter did not give any answers but made suggestions as to what could be done. Shortened seasons, changing the dates of seasons, larger 
                groups for party hunting, draw for calf tags, and no calf season are some of the possibilities.</p>

            <p>Broader consultation is planned in 2009.</p>
